## Worked case studies

Six applied, end-to-end case studies — each puts a playbook (or two) to work on a concrete company, with an ASCII topology, an entity (ER) diagram, and a sequence diagram.

| Case study | Applies | The story |

| [Anatomy of an IDOR breach](https://baluraut.github.io/security-case-study/) | Application Security | 400k records leaked via broken access control; the IR runbook |
| [The N+1 that took down Black Friday](https://baluraut.github.io/nplus1-case-study/) | Rails, PostgreSQL | A hidden N+1 melts checkout under load; find, fix, capacity-plan |
| [Shipping a production AI agent](https://baluraut.github.io/ai-agent-case-study/) | Agentic AI, MCP | Support agent from demo to safe production; guardrails + evals |
| [Corrupted recommendations restored from backup](https://baluraut.github.io/recdb-recovery-case-study/) | PostgreSQL PITR | A bad script wipes 30k rows; a targeted point-in-time restore |

## Why one library

These aren't sixteen separate subjects — they're one stack seen from sixteen heights, and the playbooks cross-reference each other on purpose: a Rails N+1 becomes a Postgres query plan (and is really a lazy-loading Proxy pattern); a container is a Linux process with a cgroup, so a Kubernetes `OOMKilled` and a bare-metal OOM are the same event; jsonb reappears as `store_accessor`; a CIDR block is a CIDR block whether it's a subnet or a VPC; a prompt-injection defense is the same least-privilege and input-validation instinct the Application Security playbook teaches as its own layer; and underneath all of it, the object-design and design-pattern playbooks name the craft your frameworks are already built from — middleware as a Chain of Responsibility of Decorators, a repository over Postgres, a circuit breaker wrapping a distributed call.

## View locally

Open `index.html` in a browser. Its cards link to the other sites once they're published.

## Publish (GitHub Pages)

Push to a repo named `field-library` (or use it as your root `baluraut.github.io` user page), then **Settings → Pages → Source: `main` / root**.

Each linked playbook must be published under the matching repo name for the cards to resolve.
